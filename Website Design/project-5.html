                My project will evaluate how literary hypertext can be used as
                an avenue for women and nonbinary individuals with
                hyperandrogenism to write illness narratives. Literary hypertext
                is a form of digital story writing that calls on the reader to
                participate in the narrative’s unfolding by selecting hyperlink
                options which branch the narrative into nonlinear directions.
                There has been a revival of scholarly and public interest in
                literary hypertext in the past 5 years, owing to the genre’s
                steep rise in popularity amongst minority game designers
                (Anthropy 21). Concentrated in the discipline of Game Studies,
                there is limited scholarly research on the potential for
                literary hypertext as a tool for writing therapeutic illness
                narratives. <br /><br />
                Turning towards the intersection of Literature, Health and
                Digital Humanities, my project questions how women and nonbinary
                individuals with hyperandrogenism can use hypertext technology
                to write illness narratives that construct positive
                relationships between their identities and the world. I created
                an online story-writing module and hypertext tutorial for ten
                participants with hyperandrogenism who have written and
                submitted their own stories based on their illness experience.
                This research will contribute to the concrete realization of a
                novel pathway to inform therapeutic approaches for emotional
                well-being related to gendered illness.
                <br /><br />
                In <i>The Wounded Storyteller</i>, Arthur Frank wrote that major
                illness has the potential to disrupt the planned destination of
                our life, but the practice of illness narrative –
                autobiographical accounts of the experience of illness –
                reclaims the capacity for telling our story (53). Despite the
                therapeutic value of traditional illness narratives, the medium
                has been criticized for upholding barriers to entry for
                marginalized groups (Couser, Signifying Bodies 58). Some
                hypertext tools have cultivated a movement of support from
                marginalized game developers who are often excluded from
                masculinist, white spaces of game development (Anthropy 90;
                Harvey 96). <br /><br />
                Literary hypertext is a culture of free production and
                distribution (tools are often free to download, open-source, and
                can export stories as HTML files to be published online) and is
                easy to use as no coding knowledge is required by the author.
                Beyond technological and financial accessibility,
                cyberliterature subverts assumed norms in traditional narrative
                mediums by promoting experimentation through multiple endings,
                branching plot, and interactive components (Harvey 101). For
                illness narratives, branching hypertext has potential as a
                productive platform for authors to learn how power functions in
                their story as they build in narrative choices that yield
                consequences (Thevenin 1). Literary hypertext has been taken up
                in Game Studies as a platform that blows open access to game
                design for marginalized communities, and I began to wonder how
                this access could translate for women with hyperandrogenism to
                write and publish illness narratives.
                <br /><br />
                Hyperandrogenism, a condition of “excessive” levels of
                testosterone in the female body, can cause “masculinizing”
                symptoms including excess body and facial hair, male-pattern
                baldness, infertility, increased muscle mass and absence of
                menstrual bleeding (Bazarganipour et al. 371). The disease
                affects 5-10% of reproductive-aged women (Yildiz 167). Medical
                literature affirms that the aesthetic expressions of
                hyperandrogenism can be benign (Sonksen et al. 826), however, in
                clinical practice women diagnosed with hyperandrogenism are
                prescribed medication to lower testosterone or else advised of
                cosmetic “solutions” including laser hair removal, medication
                for male-pattern hair loss, and bleaching cream to “restore”
                feminine embodiment (Cannon 15). The condition has been employed
                as a justification to call into question which bodily signifiers
                and hormonal nuances quantify biological sex. Through the
                reinforcement of sex norms, women and individuals with
                hyperandrogenism are made to feel that they are not “feminine”
                enough. <br /><br />
                Due to experiences of perceived subjugation in the medical
                encounter some women and individuals are turning to online
                illness narratives to write their abject bodies (Butler, Bodies
                that Matter 3) into a budding corporeal politic. My MA research
                examined the writing in an online women’s health forum and
                explored the discourse on gender and illness that was developing
                in this space. I found that multiple, deviating dialogs were
                emerging: the defiance of the medical system cultivated in this
                online space was conditional on a collective agreement to work
                to combat or “cure” symptoms that challenged standard
                femininity. Indeed, there are serious implications for
                individuals when the sexed body is read “incorrectly” or when it
                is unreadable at all (see Butler, Undoing Gender). Performing
                gender “appropriately” for these women therefore becomes a mode
                of preservation. I found that these blog posts behaved as
                illness narratives in the ways they worked to destabilize
                medicalized regulatory discourse (Couser, Recovering Bodies 34).
                <br /><br />

                Turning to scholars who have shaped methods of Digital Discourse
                Analysis (Thurlow) and Critical Narrative Analysis
                (Souto-Manning), I have developed a new Critical Discourse
                Analysis for Digital-born Narrative. New interpretations of CDA
                acknowledge a distinct lack of tools to examine the
                sociolinguistic and discursive phenomena of personal narratives
                in new media. My research will analyze interactive language
                practice in literary hypertext by attending to issues of
                meaning-making through narrative themes, larger discourses of
                power, and digital components (use of interactivity, hypertext,
                images, or sound).
                <br /><br />

                Twine, one platform for writing literary hypertext, is a freely
                accessible, open-source tool for multilinear narratives. It was
                developed by interactive fiction author Chris Klimas in 2009 to
                reduce barriers to entry for game creators of marginalized
                identities. My project utilizes Twine as the storytelling engine
                does not require the user to have previous coding knowledge
                (Skains 10). Users can access the program through their personal
                browsers, build interactive story structures, and publish their
                writing directly to HTML.
                <br /><br />

                I have recruited ten women-identifying and nonbinary
                participants, as this group size is narrow enough to build an
                individual relationship between the researcher and the
                participant, a component of my feminist research design.
                Participants meet the eligibility criteria (are at least 18
                years-old, are English-speakers, and have experienced at least
                two symptoms of hyperandrogenism). Potential participants were
                invited to a screening interview that documented eligibility and
                diversity markers. Eligible participants are completing a
                two-hour module accessed privately in an internet browser
                involving storyboarding, a Twine tutorial, and a guide for
                building a multilinear illness narrative. Once stories were
                completed, participants were interviewed about their experiences
                using literary hypertext to write an illness narrative and
                invited to share their stories in a secure folder for fellow
                participants to “play”. This project has REB clearance and
                follows all protocols suggested by the review board.
